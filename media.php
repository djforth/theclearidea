  <h3 class="main" id="sponsor"><span class="hidden">Partners for 2011: Mercedes-Benz</span></h3>
		<p>'The Clear Idea' are pleased to announce that Mercedes-Benz have been confirmed as the 'Official Partner' of the clear idea for 2011. We are very much looking forward to working with them.</p>
		<p>The Mercedes-Benz Atego is the current International Truck of the Year and The Clear Idea's vehicle is one of the first from the recently revised model range to hit Britain's roads. As well as wearing a purposeful new grille and other external features, it benefits from a string of interior enhancements that have increased comfort, safety and driveability.</p>
		<p>Like all Atego trucks with manual transmissions, the truck also came fitted with the innovative MSS (Motor Stop Start) system. This boosts fuel economy and cuts emissions, simply by switching off the engine whenever the vehicle is in neutral and stationary for three seconds - for example in heavy traffic or at lights - then switching it back on again automatically as soon as the driver depresses the clutch.</p>
<p>'The Clear Idea' launched in May 2011 so now's the time for you and your company to start thinking outside the box in order to optimise this rare 'inside the box' mobile opportunity.</p>
		<p>With that in mind we are taking pre-bookings in advance so please contact the sales team don't miss out - climb on board!!</p>
