       <p>'The Clear Idea' was born out of an idea we had over a year ago whilst devising a marketing campaign for 'The London Fashion Weekend' we worked on. At first we made the dangerous assumption that someone must have already thought of mobile, experiential advertising because to us it seemed so obvious. </p>
        <p>When we invested the time in researching the concept and competition we were amazed to find that there were very few companies exploiting this particular approach to advertising, and those that were were using unsophisticated methods.
          
          'The Clear Idea' to us is about getting the best displays in the best locations in an eye-catching and memorable manner. That means the displays have to be 3-dimensional, mobile and visual from all angles. Our mobility is provided by Mercedes-Benz who supply us state-of-art lorries which we fit with totally transparent plastic rears, which show off all their contents. </p>
        <p>There is the flexibility to use static, electronic or 'live' displays so 'The Clear Idea' can be employed across a multitude of different advertising campaigns. We are always happy to consult on the appropriateness of a new display.
          
          Our goal is to provide consumer goods & services companies with a new and effective direct marketing tool that will enhance their image and, ultimately, their return on advertising spend. </p>
