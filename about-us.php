        <p>'The Clear Idea' are pleased to announce that Mercedes-Benz have been confirmed as the 'Official Sponsor' of the clear idea for 2011. We are very much looking forward to working with them. </p>
        <p>With that in mind, bookings are being taken in advance so please contact the sales team don't miss out &ndash; climb on board!!</p>
        <p>'The Clear Idea' was born out of an idea we had whilst devising a marketing campaign for 'The London Fashion Weekend'. Initially we made the dangerous assumption that someone must have already thought of mobile, experimental advertising because, to us, it seemed so obvious. </p>
        <p>We have invested time to research the concept and competition. We were amazed to find that there are very few companies exploiting this particular approach to advertising, and those that are, are using unsophisticated methods. 'The Clear Idea', to us, is about getting the best displays in the best locations in an eye-catching and memorable manner. This means the displays are 3-dimensional and mobile. Our mobility is provided by Mercedes-Benz who supply us with state-of-the-art lorries which we fit with totally transparent plastic rears, allowing the contents to be visible from all angles.</p>
        <p>&lsquo;The Clear Idea&rsquo; provides our clients with the flexibility to use static, electronic or 'live' displays. 'The Clear Idea' can be employed across a multitude of different advertising campaigns and we are always happy to provide advice on the appropriateness of a new display. </p>
        <p>Our goal is to provide companies with a new and effective direct marketing tool that will enhance their image and, ultimately, their return on advertising spend.</p>
